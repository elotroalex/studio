Studio@Butler opened in Fall 2013, conceived and funded by a new partnership between Columbia University Libraries and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. Its current and future programming is being shaped by a number of academic groups and faculty members at Columbia University invested in new modes of scholarship and teaching.

## Founding Organizations

**[Columbia University Libraries](http://library.colmibia.edu/)**. Through its [Digital Scholarship group](http://library.columbia.edu/services/digital-scholarship.html), the libraries help Columbia faculty and students incorporate advanced computer-based approaches into their research, publications and teaching. It offers scholars paths into the latest digital resources and technologies, often in combination with resources they create themselves. The Digital Scholarship Coordinator, Alex Gil (agil@columbia.edu) schedules talks, trainings, researchathons, labs, and many other happenings in the Studio.

**Columbia University’s [Center for Teaching and Learning](http://ctl.columbia.edu/)**. When it opened in 2013, Studio@Butler housed the GSAS Teaching Center, a professional development resource for graduate students that merged into Columbia’s new Center for Teaching and Learning (CTL) in 2015. CTL holds workshops for graduate students in the Studio as well as a range of presentations, course labs, and informal gatherings. Mark Phillipson (mlp55@columbia.edu), Director of Graduate Student Programs and Initiatives, programs Studio events for the CTL.

## Partner Organizations

**The CTL’s Media, Infrastructure, and Design Studio** was founded in 1999 as the Center for New Media Teaching and Learning (CCNMTL), with the mandate to help Columbia faculty with the purposeful use of technology in teaching. It partners with instructors across the university to design, implement, and assess a great range of digital projects at the university. These projects include simulations, case studies, multimedia analysis platforms, training modules, and field-based tools. This branch of the CTL holds workshops, coding sprints, and evaluation sessions in Studio that  assess use and efficacy of its custom-designed educational environments.

## Faculty Advisors

**[Dennis Tenen](http://dennistenen.com/)**, Assistant Professor, Department of English and Comparative Literature. His research happens at the intersection of people, texts, and technology. His recent work appears on the pages of Computational Culture, boundary 2, Modernism/modernity, Public Books, and LA Review of Books on topics that range from book piracy to algorithmic composition, unintelligent design, and history of data visualization. He teaches a variety of classes in fields of literary theory, new media studies, and critical computing in the humanities. Tenen is a co-founder of Columbia's [Group for Experimental Methods in the Humanities](http://xpmethod.plaintext.in/) and author of the forthcoming Plain Text: The Poetics of Computation (Stanford UP, 2017).​

**Manan Ahmed**, Assistant Professor in the Department of History at Columbia University. He works on Space (the intersection of Geography, Landscape, and Place), Text (including Material and Visual culture), Narrative, History and Memory (ways in which past was employed discursively in Medieval and Early Modern texts). His research focus is South Asia and Islam: Intellectual History South Asia, Islam, Medieval and Early Modern Historiography and Cultural History. All of his articles can be accessed at Columbia's [Academic Commons](http://academiccommons.columbia.edu/catalog?f[author_facet][]=Ahmed,+Manan&sort=record_creation_date+desc&utf8=%E2%9C%93). All of his course syllabi can be accessed in his [Github page](https://github.com/mananahmed/syllabi). His book, [*A Book of Conquest: The Chachnama and Muslim Origins in South Asia*](http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674660113) is published by Harvard University Press, 2016. 

**Selby Schwartz**, University Writing Program, works in Writing and Gender Studies. In her work with undergraduates in UWP sections, she has pioneered the use of multimedia in composition and rhetoric studies. In course labs held in the Studio, Shelby trains her students to use Mediathread, a multimedia analysis platform built by Columbia’s CCNMTL, to engage in close reading and collective analysis of documentary film footage. This model has since been adopted by other UWP instructors, who now also run digital labs in Studio with their sections.

**Herbert Ginsburg**, Jacob F. Schiff Foundations Professor of Psychology & Education at Teachers College, oversees in-person and online-only sections of courses in early mathematical cognition. He has long worked with CCNMTL on groundbreaking video analysis tools — first the NSF-funded Video Interactions for Teaching and Learning and, more recently, Mediathread. Herb is using the Studio to plan quantitative evaluation of activities in Mediathread, with a group that includes Ryan Baker, Associate Professor of Cognitive Studies in Education at TC; TAs running sections of the course; and the Mediathread development team at Columbia.
